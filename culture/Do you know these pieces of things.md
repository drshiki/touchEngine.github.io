Nowadays the most common alternative style in the curly brace placement for the control statement (but not for function definition) is K&R style (originated in Kernighan and Plauger's *The Elements of Programming Style*) and Allman style (named after Eric Allman, and also known as "BSD style" since Allman wrote many of the utilities for BSD Unix). their respective example is as follow

K&R style: opening brace at the same line as their respective control statement; closing brace remains in a line of itself
	
	while (i < 3) {
		i++;
	}

Allman style: the brace of a control statement is on the next line, do likewise as K&R style, the closing brace is on a separate line

	while (i < 3)
	{
		i++;	
	}
