##About Common Cold

I had a cold the other day and conducted duration in past several day, hence my plan was disturbed. thank god, I begain to be on the mend last evening. in these days I only ate pork soup and rice for each meal, because I expect my cold being cured as soon as possible, to kept a health diet which I thought so when I was lack of knowledge of this disease. tonight I found out some literatures of the common cold to fill of.

And now let me write some intros and the related down to  narrate these knowledges.

###Common Cold And Influenza
- The common cold (also known as nasopharyngitis, rhinopharyngitis, acute coryza, head cold, or simply a cold) is a viral infectious disease of the upper respiratory tract which primarily affects the nose. there is in total over 200 different viral types are associated with colds.

- Influenza, commonly known as "the flu", is an infectious disease caused by the influenza virus. Symptoms can be mild to severe.

<table>
<tr><th>symptoms</th><th>cold</th><th>flu</th></tr>
<tr><td>fever</td><td>somtimes, usually mild(below 37.8 &deg;C)</td><td>typical higher(38.8-40 &deg;C, espacially in young children) persist 3-4 days</td></tr>
<tr><td>headache</td><td>occasionally, usual mild</td><td>common</td></tr>
<tr><td>generic aches</td><td>less common, usual slight</td><td>usual, often and serious</td></tr>
<tr><td>generic fatigue</td><td>somtimes</td><td>common, often worst at beginning, can last 2-3 weeks</td></tr>

- Translate to Chinese, the cold (common cold) means 普通性感冒, and the influenza is translate to 流行性感冒 (流感). well known H1N1 belongs to the latter


###How To Cure

- **A number of antivirals have been tested for effectiveness in the common cold; however as of 2009 none have been both found effective and licensed for use**. treatment thus comprises symptomatic relief. antibiotics have no effect against viral infections and thus have no effect against the viruses that cause the common cold. due to their side effects, antibiotics cause overall harm, but are still frequently prescribed. Some of the reasons that antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics.there are no effective antiviral drugs for the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits. **WE SHALL getting plenty of rest, drinking fluids to maintain hydration, and gargling with warm salt water, are reasonable conservative measures.** much of the benefit from treatment is however attributed to the placebo effect.

###What diet Shall We have With A Cold

####**Keeping Hydrated**

Perhaps even more important than what we eat will be what we drink. we are more prone to dehydration when we have a high temperature and replacing lost fluids is essential to give our body a greater chance to fight off the virus.

1. drinking hot liquids will help to dilute the mucous secretions which are responsible for congestion in the chest, throat and nasal passage. avoid cold water which may exacerbate the mucous condition.


2. broth based soups – it would appear that the old fashioned healing claims for chicken noodle soup during a cold may have some basis in fact although exactly how this works isn’t clear. the warm liquid will help to de-congest blocked airways and chicken contains an essential amino acid which has antiviral properties.


3. avoid the Alcohol, Alcohol weakens your immune system and dehydrates you. Both of these can make your colds more miserable and leave you with an even worse morning. steer clear of most alcohol in order to keep your body optimally hydrated and your immune system functioning on high. it means that you shall not drink beer and red wine.

####**Food**

1. food and drinks that are high in vitamin C can be beneficial during a cold. the body uses vitamin C to bolster the immune system. vitamin C can be found in many fruits and is particularly high in papaya, strawberries, oranges, grapefruit and melon. vegetables such as kale and cauliflower also offer high vitamin C content.

2. stay away from excess fats when you are sick. this goes for processed snacks and fried foods. foods high in fat produce inflammation and inflammation produces a less active immune system.

3. dairy products may be on the fence (in small portions), as consuming them may not aggravate some while doing so to others. dairy products can increase mucus production, and mucus is one thing you don’t need more of when you are sick. if ice cream feels good on your throat, opt for a different frozen dessert like frozen fruit bars. these will numb your scratchy throat and deliver some useful vitamin C.

4. believe it or not, eating sugar weakens our immune system. cutting back on sugar intake is a way to help prevent colds. so you shall refuse cola, juices, and oat will be better than rice.

In many cases it is as much about avoiding certain foods as it is about eating the right ones during a cold. It is sensible to avoid heavy foods containing dense protein (red meats), complex carbohydrates (pasta, potatoes, bread) and fats which use up a great deal of the body’s resources in order to digest them. Although escaping catching a cold may be difficult, eating or avoiding certain foods will certainly help to ease the passage of a cold and may help to shorten its viral presence in the body.

postscript: Oh, this post havs wasted my one night and one morning, so hard the work cross-field writing. as for my cold, I feel better than before, now whatever the health is more important than any work or study  I wholeheartedly endorse after these not very happy months. focus your health and keep your body strong, this also my expection to myself.
