There are four basic sentence structures in English:

i. A simple sentence is a sentence with just one independent clause (also called a main clause): Judy laughed..

ii. A compound sentence contains two independent clauses that are joined by a coordinating conjunction. (The most common coordinating conjunctions are: but, or, and, so.: Judy laughed and Jimmy cried.

iii. A complex sentence contains an independent clause and at least one dependent clause, a dependent clause starts with a subordinating conjunction. Examples: that, because, while, although, where, if.): Jimmy cried when Judy laughed.

iv. A compound-complex sentence contains two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent (of which at least two are independent and one is dependent): Judy laughed and Jimmy cried when the clowns ran past their seats.

Note: Independent clauses are also called main clauses. Dependent clauses are also called subordinate clauses.
