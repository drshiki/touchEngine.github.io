			<h3>Don't start to learn a programming language by reading spec</h3>
		<pre>I met some people who always recommend me to read the language spec to start learn a language when I am a newbie in programming.
it is a pity I do not continue following their so called recommendation after sevral tries. because I felt that so hard for me 
at that time. fortunately I also met some people who gave me the really useful advice so that it is not so difficult for my study. 
latter I met many other people gave those newbies this kind of so called recommendation many times. they are not all get the really 
suit their advice, maybe still suffering from the shit spec, do you?

If you are a newbie and troubled by looking for some start guides, some people recommend you to read spec to start learn a lang, to 
ignore it without hesitation, please. because those people who try to do this to newbies just for making their seasoned and professional 
image in the public and never wanna you get a relatively easy way for your study. though I think specs are necessary references for who 
want to be professional in this field. but I never recommend newbies to read them owing to that a thick and human-unreadable spec have no 
benefit to freshman in CS. of course I am not talking the scheme or islisp such few pages specs, after all, most specs can be described as 
thick and human-unreadable, such as ISO/IEC 9899 (Programming language C) more than 500 pages, ISO/IEC 14882-2011(Programming languages C++) 
more than 1300 pages, HTML Living Standard up to 11 September 2015 already more than 1100 pages, ISO/IEC 14882(Programming language Common 
Lisp) more than 1300 pages. obvious, keeping their interest is more important at incipient stage rather than seemingly endless rigorous rules, 
an average student who gets a grade-c in the foreign language exam in most cases and hardly ever read any English books holds a thick spec, 
how hard the process of reading it? I bet that he will lost interest before finishing the first chapter, even it is  worse that he will give 
up his CS school work and no programming any longer. I just want to expound if you are a pro, never mislead those newbies except you konw he 
won't go to be licked by the spec, and if you are a newbie who try to read the standard document suffering from it, stop reading it, it is a 
counsel. don't be ashamed of reading those famous classic start guides, and after you have a firmed basic, to read that spec and understand it 
as you please. always have fun with your study!
