			<h3>Do you know these pieces of things</h3>
			<p>Except foo, bar there are also other words somtimes used as nonsense identify such as foobar, fubar, baz, qux, and norf.</p>
			<p>The earliest version of "hello world" (without capital letters or exclamation mark) could be tracked  was found at 1974 Bell Laboratories internal memorandum by Brian 
			Kernighan, <i>Programming in C: A Tutorial</i> and was being well-known by the book <i>The C Programming Language</i>.</p>
			<p>The comment form /**/ comes from a programming language PL/I.</p>
			<p>The Harvard architecture isn't at the same level with Von Neumann architecture in a relation tree, ENIAC isn't the first electric computer and isn't based on Von Neumann architecture
			, Von Neumann isn't the father of computer even electric computer, and there is a relation tree as follow.</p>
			<img src="relation_tree.png">
			<p>"software engineering" this term was coined first by Anthony Oettinger and then the term was sponsored and facilitated by NATO.</p>
			<p>Pointer isn't never exclusive for C or C++, actually, almost all the mainstream programming languages have pointer.</p>
			<p>Nowadays the most common alternative style in the curly brace placement for the control statement (but not for function definition) is K&R style (originated in Kernighan and 
			Plauger's <i>The Elements of Programming Style</i>) and Allman style (named after Eric Allman, and also known as "BSD style" since Allman wrote many of the utilities for BSD Unix). 
			their respective example is as follow</p>
			<p>K&R style: opening brace at the same line as its control statement, closing brace remains in a line of itself</p>
			<pre>
			while (i < 3) {
				i++;
			}
			</pre>
			<p>Allman style: the brace of a control statement is on the next line, do likewise as K&R style, the closing brace is on a separate line</p>
			<pre>
			while (i < 3)
			{
				i++;
			}
			</pre>
			<p>The first formal description of the waterfall model was cited in the article by Winston W. Royce, but this modal was presented as a flawed modal, many people followed this 
			flawed modal in next many years, and, paid less attention to the iterative and incremental development which he advocated in this article.</p>
			<p>If you have any supplement, amendment or want to get above term's reference material or question about these article, please leave a comment or contact me te#dam.moe (replace # by @)
			, put supplements with their source links or references, and, this page is a incessant update page. thx:)</p>
