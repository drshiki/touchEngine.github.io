			<title>why is MD5 impossible to invert in theory, explaining by math</title>

			<description>
				We usually hear that MD5 could not be inverted to get the input value by the hash value, because it is well know thing, 
				however have you known why that? whether it can be proved formally? MD5 is a kind of hash function to get fixed length hash 
				value, and they are easily to be proved they can not be inverted in theory, owe it all to the prove method of existence of an 
				inverse of an original function...
