   1. my thinks
  </h3>
  <p>
   <strong>
    This part is unimportant and maybe tiresome, so if you are straightforward, don't hesitate to ignore this part because it won't result in you fail in continuing reading following paragraphs.
   </strong>
   <br/>
   I do not expect to induce the war between windows and linux, and do not make compare in any, just for that some fresh things, if you are also afraid of thinking cage and enjoy  experiencing the fresh and new like me, well, it is no doubt that you need linux if you can operate only the windows before, because linux will give you a lot of amazing experence, was different from windows. If you aren't a fresh man, no problem, there are three ways for you, one is you change your mind to be a fresh man and read this passage seriously,  the second is you do not any idea and stop to read this, the last is it is useful for you or not because you don't care it at all,read it or don't. whatever I want this passage is useful for who need it.
  </p>
  <h3>
   2. what should you do
  </h3>
  <p>
   Want to move to linux, first of all, we maybe should choose a easily navigable linux  distribution, many people recommended the UBUNTU, so I was folowing those recommendations, you also should choose which one is the most suitable and easy enough for you in vast linux distributions. Always there is one for you.
   <br/>
   Want to move to linux, you should ask youself what you usually use the computer to do at most of time secondly. I ask myself this quesion before starting to use Linux. the answer is that such as coding, listening audios, watching videos, processing some office documents and surfing the Internet, chat on QQ. Of course, it is not all,but main. I finish those work with some softwares mentioned above, the following (simplify many things)form show those depended softwares on windows.
   <br/>
  </p>
  <table>
   <br/>
   <tr>
    <th>
     work
    </th>
    <th>
     software
    </th>
   </tr>
   <br/>
   <tr>
    <td>
     coding
    </td>
    <td>
     notepad++
    </td>
   </tr>
   <br/>
   <tr>
    <td>
     play audios
    </td>
    <td>
     foobar2000
    </td>
   </tr>
   <br/>
   <tr>
    <td>
     play videos
    </td>
    <td>
     potplayer
    </td>
   </tr>
   <br/>
   <tr>
    <td>
     edit documents
    </td>
    <td>
     microsoft office
    </td>
   </tr>
   <br/>
  </table>
  <br/>
  Next step, I find their succedaneums on linux platform, the notepad++ which was my coding tool most frequently, I heared vim is one of two most powerful coding tools, so vim would be my chosen, and rhythmbox(the UBUNTU pre-installed music player) replaced foobar2000, smplyer substituted for potplayer, and the libreoffice(pre-positioned office tool suit) handle office documents. Now I am not worried about I can't implement my work because of the lacks of tools, if you well, the situation should go like mine almost.The new output is showed.
  <br/>
  <table>
   <br/>
   <tr>
    <th>
     work
    </th>
    <th>
     software
    </th>
    <th>
     succedaneum
    </th>
   </tr>
   <br/>
   <tr>
    <td>
     coding
    </td>
    <td>
     notepad++
    </td>
    <td>
     vim
    </td>
   </tr>
   <br/>
   <tr>
    <td>
     play audios

    <td>

   <br/>
   <tr>
    <td>
     play videos
    </td>
    <td>
     potplayer
    </td>
    <td>
     smplayer
    </td>
   </tr>
   <br/>
   <tr>
    <td>
     edit documents
